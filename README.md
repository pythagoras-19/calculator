# calculator
Codename Calculator. 
Essentially a random project proving that code drives architecture. 
As I solve problems and want to add more to my application, the architecture changes.
This app started as a simple CPP calculator and evolves to more complex and useful code.
A completely random and hilarious conconction of GUI, OOP, graphics, and cool CPP code

# Qt
This project uses Qt for the GUI.
"Qt is a cross-platform application framework that is widely used for developing application software that can be run on various software and hardware platforms with little or no change in the underlying codebase, while still being a native application with native capabilities and speed. Qt is currently being developed by The Qt Company, a publicly listed company, and the Qt Project under open-source governance, involving individual developers and organizations working to advance Qt. Qt is available with both commercial and open-source GPL 2.0, GPL 3.0, and LGPL 3.0 licenses." - Wikipedia
