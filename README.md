# calculator
Codename Calculator. 
Essentially a random project proving that code drives architecture. 
As I solve problems and want to add more to my application, the architecture changes.
This app started as a simple CPP calculator and evolves to more complex and useful code.
A completely random and hilarious conconction of GUI, OOP, graphics, and cool CPP code
